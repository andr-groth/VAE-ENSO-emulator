# Example data

In this folder, we provide example data for the Jupyter notebook examples in the repositories [`examples/`](/examples/) folder. The data was collected with the help of the Climate Explorer at:

> http://climexp.knmi.nl

The __VAE package__ provides a loader for the raw data from the Climate Explorer. See the [documentation](https://andr-groth.github.io/VAE-project/VAE.utils.fileio/#VAE.utils.fileio.example_read_climexp_raw_data_multi) of the VAE package for more details.
